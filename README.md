# k-NN for question answering (QA) and information retrieval (IR)

This is a learning-to-rank pipeline, which is a part of the project where we study applicability of k-nearest neighbor search methods in IR and QA applications.

In particular, it includes the software for the paper [L. Boytsov, D. Novak, Y. Malkov, E. Nyberg  (2016). *Off the Beaten Path: Letâ€™s Replace Term-Based Retrieval
with k-NN Search*, to appear in proceedings CIKM'16](http://boytsov.info/pubs/cikm2016.pdf).

# Code is there, instructions coming up soon
