## k-NN for question answering (QA) and information retrieval (IR)

This is a learning-to-rank pipeline, which is a part of the project where we study applicability of k-nearest neighbor search methods in IR and QA applications. 

Specifically, this is a ``cikm2016`` branch, which includes the software for the paper [L. Boytsov, D. Novak, Y. Malkov, E. Nyberg  (2016). *Off the Beaten Path: Letâ€™s Replace Term-Based Retrieval
with k-NN Search*, to appear in proceedings CIKM'16](http://boytsov.info/pubs/cikm2016.pdf). 

This work is covered [in the following blog post.](http://searchivarius.org/blog/text-retrieval-can-and-should-benefit-using-generic-k-nn-search-algorithms) **For more details on this branch software, please, check [the Wiki page](https://github.com/oaqa/knn4qa/wiki)**.

This software can be also used to **partially** reproduce results from the paper: [M Surdeanu, M Ciaramita, H Zaragoza. *Learning to rank answers to non-factoid questions from web collections* 
Computational Linguistics, 2011 ](http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1162/COLI_a_00051) 

The project was supported primarily by the NSF grant **#1618159** : "[Matching and Ranking via Proximity Graphs: Applications to Question Answering and Beyond](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1618159&HistoricalAwards=false)".
