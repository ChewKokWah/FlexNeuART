## k-NN for question answering (QA) and information retrieval (IR)

This is a ``bigger_rerun`` branch used in the dissertation of Leonid Boytsov: ["Efficient and Accurate Non-Metric k-NN Search with Applications to Text Matching"](http://boytsov.info/pubs/thesis_boytsov.pdf). A summary of this work is given in the [following blog post.](http://searchivarius.org/blog/efficient-and-accurate-non-metric-k-nn-search-applications-text-matching-we-need-more-k-nn).

This project has been supported primarily by the NSF grant **#1618159** : "[Matching and Ranking via Proximity Graphs: Applications to Question Answering and Beyond](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1618159&HistoricalAwards=false)".
